        <h2>Hello Love !</h2>
        <p class="intro">We first talked on 2nd March officialy after that blunder lol. I know it's been just 2 months and 8 days but I dream of us to be together forever from now only. I know I fight over small things but believe me I want you even more. After all we need our happy moments to cherish. Believe me, Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you keeps me asleep. Being with you keeps me alive.</p>

          <h3>"The Chandannagar Strand"</h3>
          <p>It was March 28, the day when we went for a hangout for the very first time, together. We clicked good selfies, had the worst thing - lonka cha ðŸ˜‚ and a nice time together. On that day though you made a wish to me which I had to fulfil at any cost....yes the boat ride on ganga and the sunset.</p>

          <h3>"The Unplanned Kolkata"</h3>
          <p>On 6th April, after the wonderful kochuri at shyambazar, we were lost and you became the guide in spite of the fact that I took you. We went and returned from elliot park and then headed off to Dharmatala and I bought you the jhumkas for the very first time. We then moved to parkstreet cemetery and then had a good lunch at Peter Cat and you had the first ever alchohol of your life and that too with me. We then headed to Victoria Memorial and from there to Princep Ghat. We had the most beautiful moment of our day the boat ride on the ganges and the sunset. We walked to a ghat, took ferry to howrah and train to home. We did a lot crazy things that day including your dropping of your phone in the boat and mine giving you the first ever rose.</p>
